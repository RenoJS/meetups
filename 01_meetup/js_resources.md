Here's a short list of javascript resources that I have found essential over the past few years.


Mozilla Developer Network
=========================

If you've ever searched for a reference on vanilla javascript or html components, you've likely received the awful w3schools as your first result.

Get the good stuff and either add `mdn` to the end of your search or search directly on the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/).


Javascript Sandbox
==================

Having a javascript problem and need to show it to someone? Why not use the code sandbox provided by [jsbin](http://jsbin.com/)?

It also allows you to include relevant dependencies and CSS; critical for collaborative debugging.


Javascript Performance
======================

Ever wonder how long an operation takes in javascript? You can crowdsource the benchmark with [jsPerf](http://jsperf.com/).

Here's a fun one: [Which is faster in javascript? String concat or Array join?](http://jsperf.com/array-join-vs-string-connect). The more you know!


Browser Compatibility
=====================

Javascript is an ever-evolving standard. But having browsers with new features means there are browsers without them. And that sucks. You can check the compatibility of various browsers at [Can I Use?](http://caniuse.com/).

For instance, what about those [web workers that Phil is going to need to build his click queue](http://caniuse.com/#feat=webworkers)?


Webkit Inspector
================

How are you debugging your client-side javascript code? Are you using Chrome's inspector? If you are, [there are some things you probably didn't know about it](http://flaviocopes.com/things-i-didnt-know-about-the-webkit-inspector/).


John Resig's Advanced Tutorials
===============================

When JQuery was first released in 2006, its author John Resig, then only 22, quickly obtained the title of a ninja-hacker god. While JQuery may seem a bit mundane nowadays with the rise of server-side node.js, it remains the major building block of javascript across the web.

Resig's [advanced javascript tutorials](http://ejohn.org/apps/learn/#) remain the introduction to the dark arts of javascript. While they're not the best examples for predictable code, the tutorials will challenge your assumptions about javascript and help you to understand the code of that too-clever bastard down the hall.


Stackoverflow
=============

Still having problems?
Well, you know about [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/tags), right?
Right?
